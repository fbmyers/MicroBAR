The Processing UI is based on processing-1.2.1.  This is the main control software for the MicroBAR, and it exposes all of the MicroBAR's current functionality (the LCD UI is not fully-functional).

The Windows driver is identical to the Arduino Mega 2560 driver except the device name has been changed.  

The MATLAB Analysis Scripts parse the log files generated by the Arduino, perform background subtraction and smoothing functions, and generate output graphs.  Future versions of this should combine the MATLAB functionality into the control UI.
